### Aloha 👋

Welcome to my github, a window to my world of code!


#### Who? 🧑‍💻 🧘‍♂️ 🧗‍♂️

hey there, my name is Jose Marcos, I am a co-founder and CTO @ [MeliorAI](http://melior.ai/). I am mostly and by training, an AI/ML engineer, 
a hobbiest tech tinkerer and curoius and enthusiastic about many areas of science. 

#### What? 🤔 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **cross-lingual question-answering** and **langauge understanding** for **information retrieval**. 

- 🔬 My research in NLP is now focused on unsupervised methods for Question Answering, Document Understanding and retrieval in large textual corpus. 
   Outside of NLP I am interested in **Hierarchical, Open-ended Reinforcement Learning** and **skill discovery**.  

#### Where & How? 🌍 

I've been working remotely for 5+ years now, which I wouldn't change. 
This allows me to be where I most like; in the mountains ⛰️ hiking, climbing, cycling, canyoning, doing alpinism... 

As a CTO and startup owner this opens the door to all the wonderful talented people around the entire globe!
